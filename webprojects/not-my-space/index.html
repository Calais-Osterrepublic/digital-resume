        <p>Hello, my full name is Jb Lumawig Balilis Masadao. My full first name is Jb Lumawig and Balilis is my middle
            name. No, Jb doesn't stand for anything, at least in this context. I was born in Missouri, but my parents
            were from the Philippines. I am taking the Computer Information Science Program here at Ozark Technial
            Community College. Believe it or not, this class isn't my first bout with HTML.</p>
        <h3>Noteworthy Interests</h3>
        <p>Ever since third grade, I've been interested in computer programming and software, largely for its
            entertainment potential. Throughout middle school, I began to meddle with programming beyond the
            conventional mold, and began working in HTML proper, specifically to facilitate the use of JavaScript. While
            many of those projects have since died away, I am appreciative of the opportunity OTC has provided to bring
            about works as grand as before. I have preserved a few of those old works and upon instruction I will bring
            them to light!</p>
        <h3>My Plans for the Future</h3>
        <p>Through the classes provided at OTC, I plan to glean the teachings needed to potentially produce software
            works that were never before possible for me. In time, I hope I may even yield a career in software. In this
            course, I wish to go back to my HTML roots and learn the skills necessary to create something better.</p>
