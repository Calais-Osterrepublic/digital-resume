        <h1>Some More Fun Facts about Me:</h1>
        <img src="images/cats.jpg" alt="A picture of my cats." width="500">
        <ul>
            <li>My favorite color is red, and I typically prefer the warm color spectrum.</li>
            <li>I live with two cats.  Cats &GT;
                Dogs, by
                the way.</li>
            <li>I converted my home laptop from Windows into Linux Mint.</li>
            <li>Out of all of the Filipino dishes I've had, my three favorites are:
                <ol>
                    <li>Adobo: Apparently, it was traditionally an Iberian (Spanish/Portugese) dish. Neat!</li>
                    <li>Pancit: A common term for many noodle dishes in the Philippines, my mom typically made them with
                        rice noodles.</li>
                    <li>Sabaw: Pronounced by me as "suh-bao" and translating directly into "soup," Sabaw was typically
                        prepared by my mom with spinach and lettuce, giving me a taste for leafy greens, and ginger.
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>I used to dabble in clay making at some point (a fruitless endeavor).</li>
        </ul>
